# Output Length Prediction Project

This project investigates whether language models have internal representations of their output length during generation.

See [README.md](README.md) for a detailed explanation of the hypothesis, approach, and methodology.

## Project Goal

Probe language models to determine if they develop awareness of output length as generation progresses, testing across tasks of varying predictability and structure.
